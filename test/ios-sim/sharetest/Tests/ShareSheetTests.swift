// XCUITest and not Maestro (caa7f97 dropped that check): Maestro finds neither the system share
// sheet's buttons by id nor by their label (the name sits in accessibilityText), and worse, it
// reports a tap on an element that is not on screen as done. XCUITest sees the whole accessibility
// tree, including the share sheet and the extension's remote view inside Safari, and fails
// honestly when something is not there.
//
// Preconditions (build-app.yml): the app is installed on the booted simulator (drive.sh did that,
// with the fixture library) and Safari has been sent to a page with `simctl openurl`.
